<p class="ex1" > My name is <strong>Ayoub</strong>. I got into photography in 2019 when I bought my professional camera, a Sony A6400, which I still use to this day. I have since upgraded my lens and <em>tremendously</em> upgraded my knowledge. I started off with making youtube videos for myself, but then once I was making music I thought that I could make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pieshelpfuloven2864">music videos</a> for myself and for friends. Currently, I am working on creating MACE, the greatest spicy preworkout that is all natural, and in that process I have been making <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gorillagarnish/">gym videos & edits</a> & that is when I started TampaShutter too. I strive to create new things that inspire & influence the best in others.
