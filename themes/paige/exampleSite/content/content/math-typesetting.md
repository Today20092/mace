Mathematical notation in a Hugo project can be enabled by using third party JavaScript libraries.
<!--more-->

In this example we will be using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/)

- Create a partial under `/layouts/partials/math.html`
- Within this partial reference the [Auto-render Extension](https://katex.org/docs/autorender.html) or host these scripts locally.
- Include the partial in your templates like so:

```
{{ if .Params.paige.math }}
{{ partial "math.html" . }}
{{ end }}
```

To enable KaTex on a per page basis include the parameter `paige.math: true` in content files

**Note:** Use the online reference of [Supported TeX Functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html)

## Examples

<p>
Inline math: \(\varphi = \dfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}= 1.6180339887â€¦\)
</p>

Block math:
$$
 \varphi = 1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\frac{1} {1+\cdots} } }
$$
